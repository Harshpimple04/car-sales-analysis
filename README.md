A simple data visualization project using Python, Matplotlib, and Plotly on car sales data.
# 🚗 Car Sales Data Visualization (Beginner Machine Learning Project)

Hi! I'm currently learning Python and taking my first steps into **data science** and **machine learning**. This is one of my beginner projects where I explored and visualized a real-world dataset of car sales using Python libraries.

This project helped me understand how to:
- Work with data using **Pandas**
- Create bar and pie charts with **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**
- Analyze patterns in sales data

## 🔰 Why I Did This Project

As someone new to machine learning, I wanted to:
- Practice handling real datasets
- Learn data cleaning and visualization
- Build my GitHub portfolio with practical projects

## 📊 Project Summary

This project analyzes a car sales dataset to identify:
- Which car models are the most sold
- How sales are distributed across different models

It includes:
- A **bar chart** to compare car model sales
- A **pie chart** to show the distribution of total sales
